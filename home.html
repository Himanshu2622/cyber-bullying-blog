                Pratigya was an associate degree honours student in medicine, extremely praised for her intellect and loved by her friends and family.
                Good things were expected of her. She would possibly one-day cure cancer… however she never can. She is dead. Some messages and photos 
                that may appear as a  joke to somebody became a threat to her life and eventually killed her…
                <br><br> Have you ever felt harassed, depressed, and even hurt thanks to somebody out there who chooses to hind behind a screen to bring pain..?. 
                If you have ever felt this, let me tell you, you're not alone. This is currently a serious downside for countless folks around the world.
                This is what we tend to define as cyberbullying.
                <br><br> Cyberbullying takes a similar approach as bullying that takes place within the playground; the victim feels frightened and alone, whereas
                the bully tries to remain anonymous. Those that participate in online bullying typically use a bunch of friends to harass their victims. 
                They will push others to feature comments on a photograph or forward one embarrassing thing to another cluster of friends. Sometimes, these 
                folks don’t even realise that they’re really bullying somebody. Comments, pictures and videos of the target are posted online making the 
                victim scared, angry and depressed. Typically, cyberbullies feel braver as they can hide their identity. Around 9.2% of 630 adolescents 
                surveyed within the Delhi-National Capital Region had experienced cyberbullying and half of them had not reported it to lecturers, guardians, 
                or the social media corporations involved. A recent study by Child Rights and You (CRY), a non-governmental organization, found that one in 
                four adolescents admitted to having seen a morphed image or video of themselves, and a majority of those cases weren't reported to the police.
