                <h3>Introduction</h3>
                <div class="info">Pratigya was an associate degree honours student in medicine, extremely praised for her intellect and loved by her friends and family. Good things were expected of her. She would possibly one-day cure cancer… however she never can. She is dead. Some messages and photos that may appear as a  joke to somebody became a threat to her life and eventually killed her…
                    <br><br>Have you ever felt harassed, depressed, and even hurt thanks to somebody out there who chooses to hind behind a screen to bring pain..?. If you have ever felt this, let me tell you, you're not alone. This is currently a serious downside for countless folks around the world.
                    This is what we tend to define as cyberbullying.
                    <br><br>Cyberbullying takes a similar approach as bullying that takes place within the playground; the victim feels frightened and alone, whereas the bully tries to remain anonymous. Those that participate in online bullying typically use a bunch of friends to harass their victims. They will push others to feature comments on a photograph or forward one embarrassing thing to another cluster of friends. Sometimes, these folks don’t even realise that they’re really bullying somebody.
                    <br><br>Comments, pictures and videos of the target are posted online making the victim scared, angry and depressed. Typically, cyberbullies feel braver as they can hide their identity. Around 9.2% of 630 adolescents surveyed within the Delhi-National Capital Region had experienced cyberbullying and half of them had not reported it to lecturers, guardians, or the social media corporations involved. A recent study by Child Rights and You (CRY), a non-governmental organization, found that one in four adolescents admitted to having seen a morphed image or video of themselves, and a majority of those cases weren't reported to the police.

                <h3>Types of Cyberbullying</h3>
                <div class="info"><b class="sub-heading">Cyber Harassment</b><br> 
                Cyber Harassment is defined as the intent to terrify, humiliate, threaten or harass someone online by 
                <img src="images\type1.jpg" alt="cyberbullying image" height="240px" width="350px" class="photo">
                sending them explicit content, threats, embarrassing emails, or blackmailing them. Sometimes the bully can even make dedicated blogs or websites just to post humiliating content or threats to solely torment their target. The most common example of Cyber harassment is offensive name-calling which may seem funny at the beginning but might turn into purposeful embarrassment. Cyber harassment also includes physical threats and sexual harassment online.<br>
                <br><b class="sub-heading">Cyber Stalking</b><br> 
                Cyber Stalking involves following a person’s movement on the internet by joining the chat rooms that are frequented by the target, bombarding them with messages and emails or posting messages or 
                <img src="images\type2.jpg" alt="cyberbullying image" height="280px" width="300px" class="photo1">
                photographs on bulletin boards that are frequently visited by the victim. The huge advantage that the stalker enjoys in Cyber Stalking is that he does not have to leave his house to stalk the target and has no fear of physical harm as he thinks he cannot be touched on the internet. Cyber Stalking usually occurs with women who are stalked by men. It is believed that over 75% of the cases reported against Cyber Stalkers are by women who are being targeted. Generally, the targets are the ones who are new to the internet and are not familiar with online safety and security. Given the enormous amount of personal information available through the internet, a Cyber Stalker can easily locate private information about a potential victim with a few mouse clicks.<br>
                <br><b class="sub-heading">Cyber Defamation</b><br>
                Cyber defamation is the act of defaming someone online. If someone posts any kind of derogatory content against any individual or any organization on a public board or social media site to defame someone then this would be considered an act of defamation. It harms the reputation and prestige of the person and makes the bully equally liable for physically hurting the target. A defamatory material could be distributed among groups of people without much hassle. A concrete proof of the gravity of the offence comes to light much later after the damage has been done. Women suffer most from it as the Indian societal structure is such that the modesty, reputation and social standing of women are very delicate.<br>
                
                <br><b class="sub-heading">Trolling</b><br>
                Trolling is the act of posting inflammatory content to intentionally make the target angry. The symbol for trolling is a black monochrome drawing of a face with a mischievous grin, which is symbolic of the 
                <img src="images\type4.webp" alt="cyberbullying image" height="240px" width="350px" class="photo">
                expression that the bully is making while trolling the victims. The main purpose of trolling is to make it a source of entertainment and to be offensive and argumentative. The bully derives pleasure from trolling people as he gets attention and feels powerful. Trolls aren't necessarily any more different than haters, but their agenda is different. They don't just want to insult a particular person, they want to start a fight, hopefully, one that has a broader application, and brings in more people than just the object of their original trolling.<br>
                
                
                <br><b class="sub-heading">Doxing</b><br>
                Doxing is the act of revealing someone’s personal information online without their consent. The purpose 
                <img src="images/type5.svg" alt="cyberbullying image" height="240px" width="280px" class="photo1">
                of the bully is to embarrass and publically humiliate their target. This can include revealing their photographs and messages or even sensitive documents. The key here is the lack of consent from the victim. The bully might hope the target to lose his/her job or be shunned by co-workers and friends.
                One of the most horrifying examples of Doxing is when the great rapper Cardi-B criticized Donald Trump. One of  Trump’s supporters revealed Cardi-B’s address online and encouraged people to set her house on fire<br>

                    platform for bullying. They spend the rest of their lives trying to recover from the trauma and ignoring the vibrations on their phone, reminding them they can’t. Bullies have always been in our society but in this digital era, the instantaneous communication enabled by social media presents a bully with new methods. Wildfire is the term used for describing the bullying practice of uploading embarrassing content within seconds after it happens. By the time an individual is made aware, it reaches beyond the limits of remedy. The person responsible for the humiliation of someone disappears into the masses as if he or she never existed. Social media provide the perfect camouflage for the responsible person to remain anonymous. Respecting boundaries is just a social convention and has disappeared. The target becomes a trending hashtag.
                    <br><br>The apps respecting anonymity were designed as a platform for the victims l to talk openly about what they feel and want to share which is purely a matter of choice, but they have become hideouts for bullies to try to do their damage without the threat of identification. This anonymity makes them feel empowered perhaps even invincible on social media. There is a great difference between the way a person acts online and how they conduct themselves in real life and once they log off, that person and that part of their life ceases to exist.
                    <img src="images\social1.jpg" alt="cyberbullying image" height="400px" width="800px" class="center">
                    <br><br>The person responsible often feels no connection to their victim and can readily distance themselves from the pain they caused which may lead the victim to take severe measures. Social media gives them protection unknowingly, access to all their target’s personal information, and a way to satisfy their boredom by taking someone’s peace away. This is the unholy trinity of online abuse.
                    <br><br>A victim, on the other hand, is exposed. The company’s commitment to freedom of expression means they take a passive approach in terms of regulation. In the event of an account being reported, a person or team will assess the content and if they deem it serious enough to warrant interference with a user’s right to express themselves, they will take an action worth nothing. The user may be barred from the platform until they remove the content that was reported, or they may be banned permanently. So, really, they get a slap on the wrist or have to open a new account which is not even a serious warning. This makes them take their wrongdoings lightly. It is thus up to the victim to defend themselves by way of two equally ineffective choices; make their account private or block the person. 
                    <br><br>They certainly didn’t stop the bullies who drove 12-year-old Rebecca Sedwick to suicide in September 2013, that’s proof of an ineffective system of law. Terrorised relentlessly for months, offline and online, Rebecca did what the sites suggested and more – she closed her Facebook account and moved to another school. It wasn’t enough. Nor was it enough for the countless victims who changed their numbers, who were accompanied to and from school by their parents, and who relocated. Social media is a great boon but also a bane.
                    <br><br>We can’t eradicate the problem of bullying, but we can curtail it. Great efforts have been made to do so but all in vain or with the least effective and casual approach by social networking sites. They open locked doors, pursue people across borders, and push them to the brink.
                    <br><br>We as a society have the ancient and predefined definition of pain and suffering to be physical and not mental. Even a discussion of mental pain in front of this society labels you as weak. The lack of discussion about the pain makes a person seek solitude and puts a target on their own back to be the next victim of cyberbullying. Change your thoughts and listen carefully because everything speaks not only the mouth.

                    <br><br>Studies have reported across a range of educational settings that females are more likely than males to be involved in cyberbullying as a victim. In contrast, the amount of females versus males involved in cyberbullying perpetration shows great variation across studies with some reporting no significant difference. This simply implies that females are in majority amongst the victims of cyberbullying as well as amongst the perpetrators of it.
                    
                    This raises a very fundamental question- <b>‘Why females are getting so much involved in cyberbullying as compared to males?’</b> The answer can be derived from the difference in the biological and early-life cultural socialization of males and females and their differential access to political, economic and ideological resources. Also, some significant differences have been observed between friendships among girls and those among boys, arising from socially constructed gender norms. Girls’ friendships have been observed to be more intensive and intimate than those of boys,  whereas boys are socialized to be autonomous and goal-oriented. 
                    
                    <br><br>Bullying is often directed at those youths who don’t conform to the general expectations of society. Or in other words, we can say the misfits in a company. These misfits are intentionally disturbed by the perpetrators for not being able to be a part of a community.
                    <br><br>Now in the case of males due to the above-mentioned differences between the two genders, it is

                    considered that the most effective way of causing harm to these misfits is by engaging with them in physical fights, that is to cause them physical harm . However, in the case of females, the most effective way of causing harm is by disturbing them emotionally, which can be done very nicely with the use of social media. 
                    The above-mentioned differences between the two genders as well as the above-mentioned psychology together make females more vulnerable than males to cyberbullying.
                    <br><br>Most of the problems in our life which seem to be very significant can be countered by changing our perspective towards them and to combat this problem also we have to do the same. So the next time someone bullies us we need to keep this thing in mind that:

                <h3>How to prevent</h3>
                <div class="info"> There are five steps for the prevention of cyberbullying:  
                    <br>Following are the steps to be taken;  
                    <br><br><b class="subhead2">STEP 1:
                    <br>To Identify:</b>
                    <img src="images\prevent2.jpg" alt="cyberbullying image" height="200px" width="250px" class="photo"> 
                    <br>Every sufferer of bullying leaves a few clues to their situation and their issues. Keeping apart oneself and staying on my own is one clue. In the event that they appear to be depressed all the time or are generally stressful and indignant, changes of their behaviour and attitude can sign that they are bullied at some place. 
                    <br><br><b class="subhead2">STEP 2: 
                    <br>Prevention methods to be guided by parents and family members:</b>
                    <img src="images\prevent1.webp" alt="cyberbullying image" height="200px" width="250px" class="photo"> 
                    <br><br>It is so important for parents to talk to their kids about cyberbullying before it happens. Parents need to teach them about the internet and how to use it responsibly and safely. The parents need have to take interest in their children’s online world and guide them in a proper way and protect them from bullying. 
                    <br><br>Parents should try to educate their children about these cyber bullying methods and how to protect themselves from these things. And also if at any point in time their child faces bullying they should try to sit and talk to them like a friend and make them feel comfortable with them and share with them. This is a very good way to build trust.
                    <br><br><b>Do not participate:</b> Parents should not encourage their children to share, or comment on information that has been posted about someone, and do not forward a hurtful text to others. And children are not encouraged to grant permission for unknown websites which are easily accessible to unknown people playing with the children’s lives. 
                    <br><br><b>Do not respond negatively:</b>  Angry and aggressive reactions can make a bad situation even worse. Instead parents should go with a calm, clear and composed approach towards the issue and talk to them nicely try to understand the situation of your child and be a supporter and be with them as friends in that issue. Parents should try not to react negatively that is the main thing that parents can do to help their child during that depressive period.
                   
                    <br><br><b class="subhead2">Step 3:

                    <br>2. Presentations, such as a speech on stopping bullying
                    <br>3. Discussions  among groups and conducting debates about topics like reporting bullying

                    <br><br>Laws against cyberbullying have been in place for quite some time. The rules are designed to protect the victim and keep the case information confidential. The law enforcement authorities should be active in the investigation. And governments should have a better network to ensure the safety of the public. Some countries with strong cyberbullying laws are examples: Canada, the United Kingdom, and United States of America and Australia. 
                    <br><br>Some Indian laws on cyberbullying:

                    A safer Metaverse is Facebook's big new plan, but it's just another term for"virtual reality" at the moment. The Metaverse is a digital macrocosm characterized by the interaction of physical, augmented and virtual reality in a shared online space. In the metaverse, users can identify themselves by creating their avatars.
                    <img src="images\meta3.jpeg" alt="cyberbullying image" height="340px" width="500px" class="photo">
                    <br>Turns out, as much as enthusiasts glamorize the metaverse as a digital utopia, the shared virtual world still carries pitfalls, like any other public-facing technology. The trouble of cybercrime is likely to increase in the metaverse as well, be it theft, identity fraud, cyberbullying, or cyberstalking. Sexual assault, particularly in the form of groping, is formerly an issue in VR. In response to a recent sexual assault in Horizon Worlds, Meta has introduced a default four-foot particular space boundary around users. Unfortunately, this is an amiss intervention that doesn't help abuse from passing. Beyond sexual abuse, name-calling and" physical" assaults like punching are common in the metaverse.
                    <br>Vivek Sharma, Vice President of Horizon, explained, “Individual Boundary will begin rolling out today everywhere inside of Horizon Worlds and Horizon Venues, and will by default make it feel like there's a nearly four-foot distance between your avatar and others. However, the system will halt their forward movement as they reach the boundary, … If someone tries to enter your Personal Boundary.”

                    pictures of many Indian women. Many of them were journalists, social workers, students and star personalities, accompanied by derogatory content. These pictures were reportedly taken from their respective Social Media accounts before being edited and uploaded to the website for an auction without their permission. All of these women were Muslims. The GitHub page and the user account that launched it has since been removed by GitHub following complaints about objectionable content. All the accused involved, including a woman, were arrested by Delhi police.
                    <br><br><b class="sub-heading">Henry’s case:</b><br> Henry was a new sixth-grade student at his school. He was looking on a social media site one day and came across a page about the school that had pictures of students. One of the pictures he saw had him

                    in it and was labelled “The Fat Nerd.” Over time more postings appeared which became nastier and nastier. It eventually got to the point where students were making comments out loud at lunch and on the playground. One teacher overheard some of the things being said to him and asked him about it. Henry proceeded to tell the teacher about the social media page and the things people were saying about him. The school was quick to respond once they heard about it. They were able to ID all the students behind the unauthorized social media page and the ones that started the bullying and made them take down the page. Although the issue was dealt with quickly by the school once they were notified about it, Henry still had to endure weeks of feeling humiliated and bullied. Henry’s parents didn’t even know what was going on because he was too embarrassed to tell them.
                    <br><br><b class="sub-heading">Megan Meier’s case:</b><br> Thirteen-year-old Megan Meier hanged herself in her room after a boy she met online, Josh Evans, told her 
                    that “the world would be a better place without her.” Little did Megan know, Josh Evans never existed. Instead, 47-year-old, Lori Drew, created a fake Myspace account and communicated with Megan as a cruel joke after Mrs Drew’s daughter and Megan had a falling out. Drew, who knew Megan was on medication for depression, had the fictitious boy flirt with Megan and made Megan think he liked her. “He” then abruptly told her he no longer liked her. That day, Megan killed herself. Although the circumstances of Meier’s case are rare and most cyberbullying victims do not resort to suicide, cyberbullying has many other serious consequences.

                <h3>Awareness</h3>
                <div class="info">Before the internet came into our life, bullying was a problem but it was a problem that didn’t extend into the pockets, bedrooms, living rooms, and beyond students’ lives. Parents, educators, and mental health professionals in our communities are aware of how damaging cyberbullying can be but preventing it could be a major challenge. Cyberbullying awareness and its prevention is everyone’s responsibility, as it’s crucial for protecting the safety of children and teens all over the world. However, sometimes it’s difficult to tell if a person is being bullied or not.
                    <br><br>There are several reasons that cyberbullying happens so often in our society, and many well-meaning adults have no idea that there is a problem at all until the issue will have become severe. It’s easy for bullies to hide cyberbullying because parents and teachers don’t see all the communications that happen between young people. Many victims are ashamed or feel like they can’t talk about what’s going on, even with the people whom they trust. According to a report, around 54% of the students who were bullied didn’t inform a parent or a trusted adult about it.
                    <br><br>It’s important for younger kids to especially learn about cyberbullying to prevent them from becoming victims or to prevent them from contributing to any cyberbullying on the internet. Awareness can be brought to younger kids at school by their educators or at home by their parents, siblings, trusted adults, etc. They can also report cyberbullying to internet service providers because today lots of content online are offensive or upsetting which often violates the terms and conditions established by social media sites and their internet service providers. Service providers are often keen to take action against the users who abuse their terms of service and violate their law.
                    <br><br>Nowadays, many more campaigns have also been established by different kinds of organizations. The

                    campaigns raise awareness about the health implications cyberbullying can have and guide them in the direction of someone that can support them. They use specific techniques to manage the situation and help victims overcome their pain and self-esteem issues. Some of the campaigns are:-
                    <br><b># CSAF(Cyber security awareness foundation)
                    <br># BeCyberSmart
                    <br># Refuse The Abuse</b>
                    <br><br>The Cybersmile Foundation is a cyberbullying charity committed to tackling all forms of online bullying, abuse, and hate campaigns. This community was founded back in 2010 in response to the increasing number of cyberbullying related incidents of depression, eating disorders, social isolation, self-harm and suicides. Cybersmile provides support to victims, their friends and their families through social media interaction, email and helpline support. They also run an annual event, Stop Cyberbullying Day, to draw attention to this major issue.
                    <br><br>Over the last few years due to the increase in high-profile cyberbullying cases, many new laws have been implemented by lawmakers. There have been a number of cases involving teens who have been harassed online by their peers, groups of individuals, and even their boyfriends and girlfriends, leading to deaths that could have been prevented with timely intervention. Though no law can prevent cyberbullying altogether, having laws against cyberbullying is important for raising awareness and prosecuting crimes appropriately.

                    <img src="images\awareness1.jpg" alt="cyberbullying image" height="240px" width="350px" class="photo2">
                    <br>Because the federal government has not passed a national cyberbullying or bullying prevention legislation, each state is responsible for writing and enacting its own law. There are several states and countries across the globe which have implemented seemingly effective cyberbullying laws. Some of the cyberbullying laws in the world are:-
                    <br><b>● Canada- Under the education act, students who are engaged in cyberbullying may face suspension from the school and repeat bullies may face expulsion and possible time in jail.
                    <br>● United Kingdom- Under the malicious communication act, cyberbullying could result in six or more months in prison.
                    <br>● Hawaii- Under the SB2094 law, students who are engaged in cyberbullying are fined $100 per offence.
                    <br>● United States- States like California, Colorado, Connecticut and Illinois have implemented laws that punish cyberbullying with suspension and expulsion.
                    <br>● In Montana, there are no laws to protect the victims from cyberbullies, but some schools have some policies in their handbooks.

                    <br><br>Bill Belsey, a Canadian educator first coined the term cyberbullying. The main intention of cyberbullying is to harm a person mentally. Though this phenomenon caught the attention of researchers as the interaction on social media sites grew larger in the mid-2000s, the problem actually dates back to the 1990s, with most cases unreported or simply unnoticed due to lack of evidence. The following are the first few known cases of suicides that resulted from cyberbullying.

                    <br><br>Bullies tend to be more aggressive online as there are rarely any real-world consequences of their actions. It can have serious impacts on the self-esteem and mental health of people who experience it. More teen suicides 
                    are now attributed in some way to cyberbullying than ever before. A few important facts and recent statistics on cyberbullying trends are given below.
                    
                    <br><br><b>• India, Brazil, and the United States are the top three countries where cyberbullying is most common.

                    <br><br>Now, cyberbullying has become a growing problem in countries around the world. Thus, we are urged to ask “Why do people cyberbully?” The answer to that lies in the fundamental nature of human beings which has existed forever, the superior complexity. It’s a tendency of humans to 
                    always want to be better than others in some or the other way by constantly comparing oneself with others. This leads to feelings of inferiority over others’ accomplishments, disgrace towards a different religion, disgust for a particular race, and jealousy of others’ appearances, financial status, which fills one's mind with negative emotions and contempt for others. Overflow of such thoughts and losing control over emotions is why people succumb to bullying others, giving them a sense of joy. And digital media just so happens to provide a larger field and a better platform to spread hatred anonymously. Children who are online are at risk, and the more you are online the more likely you are to have negative experiences. However, it is important to note that due to the features of digital media, the fact that we cannot see things like facial expression or body language, make it harder to feel empathy. That can also lead to many cases of almost unintentional cases of cyberbullying.
                    
                    
                    <br><br>Although bullying behaviour has always been around since the beginning of civilization and it too can sometimes leave a lifelong trauma making one suffer physically and mentally, it differs in many ways from bullying with the use of digital technologies. A few are listed below.
                    
                    <br><br><b>• Cyberbullies can hide behind usernames and stay anonymous. 
                    <br>• Cyberbullying victims can be contacted at any time 24/7.
                    <br>• There is no supervision of social media networks. It is difficult to trace back crime on social media. The reach can be global with a single click.
                    It can be a wide area uncontrollable spread. Consequences are irreversible.
                </b>
                     
                    <br><br>However, the reason why cyberbullying is so different is because unlike traditional bullying, which usually has to be done in person, those who are bullied online may find it nearly impossible to have any breaks from their bullies. It is repeated behaviour, aimed at scaring, angering, or shaming those who are targeted. It's about the relentless acts of the day after day experiences. ‘’It’s like a paper cut a thousand times every day’’, words of a victim describing cyberbullying make evident its horror.
