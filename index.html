                <h3>Types of Cyberbullying</h3>
                <div class="info"><b class="sub-heading">Cyber Harassment</b><br> 
                Cyber Harassment is defined as the intent to terrify, humiliate, threaten or harass someone online by 
                <img src="images\type1.jpg" alt="cyberbullying image" height="240px" width="350px" class="photo">
                sending them explicit content, threats, embarrassing emails, or blackmailing them. Sometimes the bully can even make dedicated blogs or websites just to post humiliating content or threats to solely torment their target. The most common example of Cyber harassment is offensive name-calling which may seem funny at the beginning but might turn into purposeful embarrassment. Cyber harassment also includes physical threats and sexual harassment online.<br>
                <br><b class="sub-heading">Cyber Stalking</b><br> 
                Cyber Stalking involves following a person’s movement on the internet by joining the chat rooms that are frequented by the target, bombarding them with messages and emails or posting messages or 
                <img src="images\type2.jpg" alt="cyberbullying image" height="280px" width="300px" class="photo1">
                photographs on bulletin boards that are frequently visited by the victim. The huge advantage that the stalker enjoys in Cyber Stalking is that he does not have to leave his house to stalk the target and has no fear of physical harm as he thinks he cannot be touched on the internet. Cyber Stalking usually occurs with women who are stalked by men. It is believed that over 75% of the cases reported against Cyber Stalkers are by women who are being targeted. Generally, the targets are the ones who are new to the internet and are not familiar with online safety and security. Given the enormous amount of personal information available through the internet, a Cyber Stalker can easily locate private information about a potential victim with a few mouse clicks.<br>
                <br><b class="sub-heading">Cyber Defamation</b><br>
                Cyber defamation is the act of defaming someone online. If someone posts any kind of derogatory content against any individual or any organization on a public board or social media site to defame someone then this would be considered an act of defamation. It harms the reputation and prestige of the person and makes the bully equally liable for physically hurting the target. A defamatory material could be distributed among groups of people without much hassle. A concrete proof of the gravity of the offence comes to light much later after the damage has been done. Women suffer most from it as the Indian societal structure is such that the modesty, reputation and social standing of women are very delicate.<br>
                
                <br><b class="sub-heading">Trolling</b><br>
                Trolling is the act of posting inflammatory content to intentionally make the target angry. The symbol for trolling is a black monochrome drawing of a face with a mischievous grin, which is symbolic of the 
                <img src="images\type4.webp" alt="cyberbullying image" height="240px" width="350px" class="photo">
                expression that the bully is making while trolling the victims. The main purpose of trolling is to make it a source of entertainment and to be offensive and argumentative. The bully derives pleasure from trolling people as he gets attention and feels powerful. Trolls aren't necessarily any more different than haters, but their agenda is different. They don't just want to insult a particular person, they want to start a fight, hopefully, one that has a broader application, and brings in more people than just the object of their original trolling.<br>
                
                
                <br><b class="sub-heading">Doxing</b><br>
                Doxing is the act of revealing someone’s personal information online without their consent. The purpose 
                <img src="images/type5.svg" alt="cyberbullying image" height="240px" width="280px" class="photo1">
                of the bully is to embarrass and publically humiliate their target. This can include revealing their photographs and messages or even sensitive documents. The key here is the lack of consent from the victim. The bully might hope the target to lose his/her job or be shunned by co-workers and friends.
                One of the most horrifying examples of Doxing is when the great rapper Cardi-B criticized Donald Trump. One of  Trump’s supporters revealed Cardi-B’s address online and encouraged people to set her house on fire<br>

They sap our strength. Some of the cuts are so small they’re barely visible. Others are huge and gaping, leaving scars that never heal. Either way, they accumulate. We carry them everywhere, to and from school and work, at home while raising our children, at our places of worship, anytime we try to advance.”</i>

                    </div>
                    <br><br>Studies have reported across a range of educational settings that females are more likely than males to be involved in cyberbullying as a victim. In contrast, the amount of females versus males involved in cyberbullying perpetration shows great variation across studies with some reporting no significant difference. This simply implies that females are in majority amongst the victims of cyberbullying as well as amongst the perpetrators of it.
                    
                    This raises a very fundamental question- <b><i>‘Why females are getting so much involved in cyberbullying as compared to males?’</i></b> The answer can be derived from the difference in the biological and early-life cultural socialization of males and females and their differential access to political, economic and ideological resources. Also, some significant differences have been observed between friendships among girls and those among boys, arising from socially constructed gender norms. Girls’ friendships have been observed to be more intensive and intimate than those of boys,  whereas boys are socialized to be autonomous and goal-oriented. 
                    
                    <br><br>Bullying is often directed at those youths who don’t conform to the general expectations of society. Or in other words, we can say the misfits in a company. These misfits are intentionally disturbed by the perpetrators for not being able to be a part of a community.
                    <br><br>Now in the case of males due to the above-mentioned differences between the two genders, it is 
                    <img src="images\role3.png" alt="cyberbullying image" height="240px" width="500px" class="photo">
                    considered that the most effective way of causing harm to these misfits is by engaging with them in physical fights, that is to cause them physical harm . However, in the case of females, the most effective way of causing harm is by disturbing them emotionally, which can be done very nicely with the use of social media. 
                    The above-mentioned differences between the two genders as well as the above-mentioned psychology together make females more vulnerable than males to cyberbullying.
                    <br><br>Most of the problems in our life which seem to be very significant can be countered by changing our perspective towards them and to combat this problem also we have to do the same. So the next time someone bullies us we need to keep this thing in mind that:

                <div class="info"><b class="sub-heading">Metaverse:</b><br>
                    A safer Metaverse is Facebook's big new plan, but it's just another term for"virtual reality" at the moment. The Metaverse is a digital macrocosm characterized by the interaction of physical, augmented and virtual reality in a shared online space. In the metaverse, users can identify themselves by creating their avatars.
                    <img src="images\meta3.jpeg" alt="cyberbullying image" height="340px" width="500px" class="photo">
                    <br>Turns out, as much as enthusiasts glamorize the metaverse as a digital utopia, the shared virtual world still carries pitfalls, like any other public-facing technology. The trouble of cybercrime is likely to increase in the metaverse as well, be it theft, identity fraud, cyberbullying, or cyberstalking. Sexual assault, particularly in the form of groping, is formerly an issue in VR. In response to a recent sexual assault in Horizon Worlds, Meta has introduced a default four-foot particular space boundary around users. Unfortunately, this is an amiss intervention that doesn't help abuse from passing. Beyond sexual abuse, name-calling and" physical" assaults like punching are common in the metaverse.
                    <br>Vivek Sharma, Vice President of Horizon, explained, “Individual Boundary will begin rolling out today everywhere inside of Horizon Worlds and Horizon Venues, and will by default make it feel like there's a nearly four-foot distance between your avatar and others. However, the system will halt their forward movement as they reach the boundary, … If someone tries to enter your Personal Boundary.”
                    <br><br><b class="sub-heading">Bulli Bai case:</b><br> The Bulli Bai case is related to an online mock silent auction of Radical Islamist Women in India. Reportedly on 1 January 2022, a GitHub Pages site was launched that contained allegedly doctored 
                    <img src="images\meta2.webp" alt="cyberbullying image" height="240px" width="350px" class="photo1">
                    pictures of many Indian women. Many of them were journalists, social workers, students and star personalities, accompanied by derogatory content. These pictures were reportedly taken from their respective Social Media accounts before being edited and uploaded to the website for an auction without their permission. All of these women were Muslims. The GitHub page and the user account that launched it has since been removed by GitHub following complaints about objectionable content. All the accused involved, including a woman, were arrested by Delhi police.
                    <br><br><b class="sub-heading">Henry’s case:</b><br> Henry was a new sixth-grade student at his school. He was looking on a social media site one day and came across a page about the school that had pictures of students. One of the pictures he saw had him 
                    <img src="images\meta1.png" alt="cyberbullying image" height="240px" width="350px" class="photo2">
                    in it and was labelled “The Fat Nerd.” Over time more postings appeared which became nastier and nastier. It eventually got to the point where students were making comments out loud at lunch and on the playground. One teacher overheard some of the things being said to him and asked him about it. Henry proceeded to tell the teacher about the social media page and the things people were saying about him. The school was quick to respond once they heard about it. They were able to ID all the students behind the unauthorized social media page and the ones that started the bullying and made them take down the page. Although the issue was dealt with quickly by the school once they were notified about it, Henry still had to endure weeks of feeling humiliated and bullied. Henry’s parents didn’t even know what was going on because he was too embarrassed to tell them.
                    <br><br><b class="sub-heading">Megan Meier’s case:</b><br> Thirteen-year-old Megan Meier hanged herself in her room after a boy she met online, Josh Evans, told her 
                    that “the world would be a better place without her.” Little did Megan know, Josh Evans never existed. Instead, 47-year-old, Lori Drew, created a fake Myspace account and communicated with Megan as a cruel joke after Mrs Drew’s daughter and Megan had a falling out. Drew, who knew Megan was on medication for depression, had the fictitious boy flirt with Megan and made Megan think he liked her. “He” then abruptly told her he no longer liked her. That day, Megan killed herself. Although the circumstances of Meier’s case are rare and most cyberbullying victims do not resort to suicide, cyberbullying has many other serious consequences.
